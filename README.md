# AddressBook.py
Address book used for important work contacts.

The address book takes user input in string format, converts it to uppercase, and parses through the dictionary to match the user input with the dictionary stored in the "contact_list" variable. When it finds a match, it returns the phone number and the email associated with the key that the user enters. 

The program is CLI, but I may work on a GUI in the near future.
